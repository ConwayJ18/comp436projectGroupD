# comp436projectGroupD
For Group D's final COMP 436 project. (Jess Conway, Ting Liu, Yang Li, Waleed Alduraywish)

<h1>Progress by Week-----</h1>

<h2>WEEK 1:</h2> Groups were assigned and ideas were pitched for the final project. Nothing was decided on but everyone had an idea for what we should do and that seemed like sufficient progress for the week. We then decided that we would vote in class the following week. We also created a Google Hangout for easier out-of-class communication

<h2>WEEK 2:</h2> We voted on what project we would be attempting and finally settled on the fashion project. We had the idea approved by Dr. Hayward but made no further progress during this week.

<h2>WEEK 3:</h2> The details of the project began to come together. We established that the project would be a fashion catalog/database that allows a user to search for images and outfits based on a pre-specified set of attributes (i.e. brand, type, color, size, gender...). In general, this would act very much like a Google Image search. We also began brainstorming tags that we would like to have included in the project so that we could use these tags as searchable attributes.

<h2>WEEK 4:</h2> We decided that the easiest way to grab images to bring to the project would be to simply note their URL on different store websites. Should we need to save these to a hard-drive instead, we will deal with that later. Also, Waleed joined the group.

<h2>WEEK 5:</h2> We built a one-item catalog and began to work on the XSL stylesheet that will serve as our interface. These things will allow us to begin testing as a proof-of-concept, and then once we get them working we can expand our catalog further to include more items. We will also need to implement a search feature at some point.

<h2>WEEK 6:</h2> Everyone is going to add at least five items to the catalog so we have a working proof-of-concept for DEV week with a relatively useful search function. Other things that need to be done this week are yet to be worked out.

<h2>WEEK 7:</h2> The DEV week presentation went smoothly. Suggested improvements include the following — 1) Add the sort/filter bar. 2) Add a <season> tag. 3) Add a count of the products in the grid at any given time. 4) Add more product, favoring categories that are underrepresented in the current catalog. 5) Clean up the interface to be a bit more appealing. 6) Allow for clickable images so that a zoom function can be added. 7) Make it more responsive.

As of DEV week, this has been the work breakdown:
<h3>JESS CONWAY —</h3> I created the team's Github repository and made the basic catalog.xml and interface.xsl files. As a result, the decision for how each catalog item is formatted (the tags that each item should contain, the order they should be in, etc...) was essentially made by me and the basic table (minus any additional features, like sorting/coloring/image sizing) is also my doing. Once this was finished I also added my share of the 20 catalog items (5 items for each member) for DEV week.

<h3>YANG LI —</h3> Edit catalog.xml and interface.xsl (update the style of table in details). Work with Ting update template_choose.xml and template_choose.xsl. Add 5 items for the projects. Update the screenshots for preview. Create PPT for DEV week.

<h3>TING LIU —</h3> Created the project idea. Wrote 5 items for xml file. Created sortbyprice.xsl and Template_choose.xsl. Debugged the code and fixed errors. Helped with PPT.

<h3>WALEED ALDURAYWISH —</h3> Add 5 items for the projects. Edit catalog.xml, to make pictures work. Add examples for xsd and dtd in GitHub for future uses. Contribute in the PPT for DEV week.
